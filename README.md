# Color tracker
The python code detects and tracks any object of primary color(red, green or blue).


Title

AN EFFICIENT COLOR-BASED OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING IN VIDEOS


ABSTRACT: In this paper, a new efficient color based object detection and tracking of a moving object in a video is discussed, which is based on a new formula, 
proposed by the author, to convert an RGB image into an intensity image. The proposed formula has a great discriminating ability to highlight a shade of a particular 
primary colorin an image and suppress all other colors. This discriminating ability is used to detect an object of any primary color shade very efficiently as
it eliminates many additional processing steps, such as segmentation, histogram matching, etc, used in previously reported color based trackers.

3D Trajectory Reconstruction Using Color-Based Optical Flow and Stereo Vision

Abstract:

Automatic trajectory estimation of a moving object in a video is one of the most active research areas of computer vision, which finds many practical applications, 
such as development of sport playing robots, predicting trajectory for avoiding obstacle collision, automatic navigation of driverless vehicles, monitoring target hitting, etc. 
However, most of the work reported in literature only considers monocular videos. Due to the availability of low price stereo cameras, many applications take their advantages 
by incorporating depth information. In this paper, the 3D trajectory of a primary-color (red or green or blue) object is estimated using color-based optical flow and stereo vision.
The purpose of using stereo vision is to gain depth information for generating 3D trajectory. The system has been tested on many stereo videos and experimental results are quite accurate. Besides, the low computation time required for finding depth of the tracked path makes it suitable for real time applications.
